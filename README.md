Some stories are found, not written.

This repository contains a sequence of posts.
They are ordered by appearance, not importance.

Each post begins with something that happened.
Sometimes, it continues where history stopped speaking.

Nothing here is optimized.
Nothing here is summarized.
Nothing here asks for belief.

If you arrived by accident, that’s fine.
If you leave without reading, that’s also fine.

The archive will grow when it needs to.
