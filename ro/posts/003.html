      <h1>Post 003 — The Day the Ground Said “Nope”</h1>
      <div class="meta">The world exists first. We live on it second.</div>

      <p>A long time ago, in 1755, there was a city called Lisbon.</p>

      <p>Lisbon was doing great.</p>

      <p>People lived there.</p>

      <p>People worked there.</p>

      <p>People prayed there.</p>

      <p>Buildings were tall. Streets were narrow. The ground was doing its job by being ground.</p>

      <p>Everyone trusted it.</p>

      <p>That was mistake number one.</p>

      <p>It was November 1st, which was a big religious day. Churches were packed. Candles were lit everywhere. Bells were ringing like usual. The city was fully in “normal day” mode.</p>

      <p>And then the ground did something unexpected.</p>

      <p>It moved.</p>

      <p>Not metaphorically.</p>

      <p>Not emotionally.</p>

      <p>Physically.</p>

      <p>At first people were like,</p>

      <p>“Hmm. Weird.”</p>

      <p>Then the walls started cracking and people were like,</p>

      <p>“Okay no.”</p>

      <p>Floors wobbled. Buildings shook. Stuff that had been standing for hundreds of years suddenly forgot how standing worked.</p>

      <p>The shaking didn’t just happen once.</p>

      <p>It stopped.</p>

      <p>Then came back.</p>

      <p>Which is honestly rude.</p>

      <p>When it finally stopped for real, people were relieved for about five seconds. Then they noticed fires. Lots of fires. Candles had fallen over. Houses were burning. Smoke was everywhere.</p>

      <p>So people did the obvious thing.</p>

      <p>They ran toward the river.</p>

      <p>The river had always been there. The Tagus River was calm, wide, reliable. Boats floated on it. Water usually means safety, right?</p>

      <p>Except the river was acting… suspicious.</p>

      <p>The water pulled away from the shore. Like it was backing up to get a better angle. Parts of the riverbed showed up that no one had ever seen before.</p>

      <p>Some people stared.</p>

      <p>Some people walked closer.</p>

      <p>This was mistake number two.</p>

      <p>Because a few minutes later, the water came back.</p>

      <p>Fast.</p>

      <p>A huge wave rushed into the city, smashing boats, buildings, and people together like the world had hit the “shuffle” button. Then it pulled back again, leaving everything even worse than before.</p>

      <p>And if that wasn’t enough, the city caught on fire again.</p>

      <p>Lisbon burned for days.</p>

      <p>When things finally calmed down, a massive part of the city was gone. Houses, churches, streets, records — erased. Tens of thousands of people died.</p>

      <p>No one had caused it.</p>

      <p>No one had planned it.</p>

      <p>No one had failed a test.</p>

      <p>The ground just… did that.</p>

      <p>Afterward, people tried to make sense of it.</p>

      <p>Some said it was punishment.</p>

      <p>Some said it was random.</p>

      <p>Some said the world was broken.</p>

      <p>Others said, “Okay, but what actually happened?”</p>

      <p>And that group started doing something new.</p>

      <p>They asked questions.</p>

      <p>They wrote things down.</p>

      <p>They compared damage.</p>

      <p>They tried to learn how buildings fall, how waves travel, how cities should be built if the ground sometimes decides to move.</p>

      <p>Lisbon was rebuilt. Slower. Smarter. Streets wider. Buildings designed to move instead of fighting the earth like it was personal.</p>

      <p>The earthquake didn’t explain itself.</p>

      <p>It didn’t apologize.</p>

      <p>It didn’t promise not to do it again.</p>

      <p>It just showed everyone something important:</p>

      <p>The world exists first.</p>

      <p>We live on it second.</p>

      <p>And sometimes it reminds us.</p>

      <p>That day, the ground said:</p>

      <p>“I am.”</p>

      <p>And then it kept being the ground.</p>
